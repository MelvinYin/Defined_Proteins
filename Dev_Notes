To update deployment:
cd to dockerfile folder
docker build -t definedproteins --build-arg CACHEBUST=$(date +%s ) .
docker image tag definedproteins melvinyin/definedproteins:latest
docker image push melvinyin/definedproteins:latest

On the deployed side:
docker container ls => docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
docker system prune -a
docker pull melvinyin/definedproteins
docker run --publish 80:80 melvinyin/definedproteins /bin/bash ./docker_build.sh

To add security:
1. Remove debug mode, set DEBUG=False in src/site_main/settings.py
2. Remove allowing all hosts, to include only localhost, ec2-smth, and
defined-proteins.com
3. For http that's about it, unless you also want to hide django secretkey,
which doesn't do that much
4. To add https, use the uwsgi dockerfile from my own portfolio website, but
this requires either doing a docker-in-docker, so uwsgi call this dockerfile.
This is preferred perhaps because then not much changes need to be added here.
Or, merge this dockerfile into the uwsgi one (do not do the other way, getting
uwsgi to work properly is harder). uwsgi relies on python3.8-buster, apt seems
to work so in theory it should work. In practice, good luck. Just keep http,
there are better hills to die on.
